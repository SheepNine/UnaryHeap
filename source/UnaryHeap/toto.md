# To do before release

* Review all of the code added to UnaryHeap libraries
** Double-check documentation XML for consistency/correctness
** Verify that new code added has good test coverage
* See what can be done to speed it up
** Burning a lot of time in sorting lists it seems
** How much is happening in GCD?
* Generate surfaces for other entities besides `worldspawn`

* Heal T-Joins in BSP (3D only)
