<P>Patchwork is a utility that can compose images out of tilesets into arrangement files (.arr).</P>
<P>To begin using it, open the application, and run the 'View/Add Tileset...' command. Select a tileset image to arrange. (Several tilesets have been included in the Examples directory, along with an arrangement file that composes them into an image).</p>
<p>Once you have a tileset selected, you can select an active tile in the left-hand window, and begin editing the arrangement in the right-hand window. The arrangement window supports the following commands:</P>
<ul>
    <li>Left click: replace the tile clicked with the active tile</li>
    <li>Shift-left click: set the active tile to the tile clicked</li>
    <li>Right click: replace a group of tiles according to the currently-selected stamp in the Stamp menu</li>
</ul>
<p>Right-clicking a tile in the tie left-hand window will swap all occurrences of that tile and the active tile in the arrangement.</p>
<p>The right-click commands to replace multiple tiles in the arrangement use the same layout as the source tileset. A well-laid-out source tileset can vastly improve your productivity.</P>
<p>More than one source tileset can be added to the editing context, as long as the source images have the same width and tile size. The indices of the tiles in the second and subsequent tilesets added start from the number of tiles in tilesets that were added before.</p>
<P>The latest version of this utility, and its source code, can be found at <A href="https://github.com/SheepNine/UnaryHeap">GitHub</A>.</P>
