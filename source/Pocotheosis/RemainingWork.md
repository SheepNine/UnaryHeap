# Remaining Work

* Builders should have withVariableName() chaining methods for primitive values too
* Analyze code coverage and see if there is anything else that needs tests
* Round out ClassDictionaryPocoTests
* Set `<AnalysisMode>Recommended</AnalysisMode>` in this project and then fix all the compiler errors
* Allow null values for Pocos and strings
* Allow polymorphic pocos
* Allow categories of pocos so that polymorphism can be constrained
* XSD for manifest file for ease of authoring
