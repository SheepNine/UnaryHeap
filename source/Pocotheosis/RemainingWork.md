# Remaining Work

* Builders should have withVariableName() chaining methods for primitive values too
** Also dictionaries and lists?
* Analyze code coverage and see if there is anything else that needs tests
* Round out ClassDictionaryPocoTests
** Make test suite comprehensive and exhaustive
* Allow polymorphic pocos
* Allow categories of pocos so that polymorphism can be constrained
* XSD for manifest file for ease of authoring
